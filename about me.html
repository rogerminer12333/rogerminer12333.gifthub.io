now about me

I am around 18 years old at the time of 2019 and I like to make lots 
of random things using things, apps, or program's at the time of me 
making this I have used adobe photoshop, illustrator, after effects, 
processing, and meshmixer and I know how to use them fairly well i 
hope to keep using more programs in the future. I currently like 
working with photoshop since it allows me to add effects to the photos 
I took with photography both regular photography and in digital 
photography and i hope to learn more in the future.
